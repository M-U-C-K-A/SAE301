# Look Down
A website about eco-citizenship, created as part of our studies. Its goal is to raise awareness about the importance of protecting our environment based on a movie about eco-citizenship. It is developed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and uses libraries such as AOS.
It has two paths:

`"Film"` path: It presents the selected film and information about it. It also includes information about our project and the reasons why we created it.
`"Act"` path: It offers quizzes on eco-citizenship and information on concrete actions that everyone can take to protect the environment. It also allows you to commit to taking actions and share your commitment with your friends on social media.

## Installation
Download or clone this repository
Install the dependencies using the command npm install
Launch the website using the command npm start

## Usage
Open your browser and access the address `http://localhost:3000` to see the website in action. You can navigate through the different sections of the website to learn more about eco-citizenship and the featured film.

## Graphic charter
Our project Look Down has been designed with a sleek and elegant graphic charter to reflect the importance of ecology and the need to protect our environment.

> The main colors used in the project are :
>- ![#81CD79](https://placehold.co/15x15/81CD79/81CD79.png) `#81CD79` green is used to represent ecology and nature,
>- ![#F5F5F5](https://placehold.co/15x15/F5F5F5/F5F5F5.png) `#F5F5F5` white is used to represent the purity of the text,
>- ![#1E1E1E](https://placehold.co/15x15/1E1E1E/1E1E1E.png) `#1E1E1E` black is used to represent elegance and sophistication.

>- The typography used for titles is "Outfit Medium Semibold" to highlight the importance of the information presented.

By using a combination of bright colors and refined typography, we have created a professional and convincing look that reflects the importance of ecology and preserving our environment. We hope you enjoy our design as much as we did in creating it.
